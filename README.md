# Books-analyses: A Jupyter notebook for exploring audiobook data

This project is an analysis of an audible dataset using a Jupyter notebook. I created this project to practice my data analysis and visualization skills using Python and various libraries. The project aims to find some interesting insights about audiobooks, such as the most popular genres, the distribution of ratings, the correlation between ratings and reviews, etc.

## Installation and Running

To run this project, you need Python 3.8 or higher and the following libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc. You also need to download the audible dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). 

To install the libraries, you can use pip or conda. To run the notebook, you can use Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
# or
conda install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage

The notebook consists of four parts: data loading and cleaning, data exploration, data visualization, and data analysis. In each part, I use different functions or methods to manipulate and examine the data. The output of the notebook is a series of graphs and tables that show the findings of the analysis. Some examples are:

- A bar chart that shows the top 10 genres by number of audiobooks.
- A histogram that shows the distribution of ratings by genre.
- A scatter plot that shows the relationship between ratings and reviews by genre.
- A table that shows the summary statistics of each genre.
